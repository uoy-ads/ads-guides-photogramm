# 5 Case study: Close-Range Photogrammetry for Architecture at Ostia Antica, Italy

## 5.1 About the Project

Ostia Antica, once a port and military outpost for the Roman Republic, is today a superb example of typical Roman urbanism. The people that once populated this ancient city came from many different walks of life and covered the entire social spectrum. It was because of this local diversity that a two semester honors colloquium called "Visualizing the Roman City" was created at the University of Arkansas using Ostia as its test case. This multidisciplinary course is aimed toward students studying in Architecture, Geosciences, Anthropology, Archaeology, and Classical Studies. Students in this class are not limited to learning through lecture alone, are able to visually reunite Roman sculptures and paintings with their architectural contexts in a way that can be navigated in three dimensions by creating digital reconstructions. 

This work was supported by a generous grant from the University of Arkansas Honors College, and by the School of Architecture, the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST), and the Humanities Program in Fulbright College. 

## 5.2 Data Collection and Documentation

In the spring of 2007, a crew of researchers from the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies visited the site of Ostia Antica with the goal of collecting three-dimensional spatial information. One of these types of spatial information was collected in the form of high-quality photographs. In order to extract three-dimensional models of various structures at the site, photogrammetric quality photographs were collected using a high-end digital SLR handheld camera, and taken anywhere from one to 20 meters off the ground. In an effort to capture the social diversity of Ostia, data collection was focused on three main structures, each belonging to a different step of the social ladder. 

Data collection consisted of digital images captured with a 50mm (fixed) Nikkor lens on a Nikon D200 DSLR camera, and positional data recorded with a Trimble 5600 total station. Calibration images were taken on site with the Nikon D200 and 50mm lens and a printed 36" x 36" calibration target from the software package PhotoModeler. Before any images were taken, the camera and lens settings were fixed so that each image was taken with the same focus (set to infinity in this case). 

A total of 43 digital images were captured for the project, averaging 14 images per structure. Eight to ten total station control points were collected for each structure, allowing for the absolute orientation of the photogrammetric model. 

Throughout the data collection process, the position and orientation of each image were indicated on a hand drawn sketch of the structure and surrounding area. Additional photos were taken for each control point to clearly indicate their exact position.
